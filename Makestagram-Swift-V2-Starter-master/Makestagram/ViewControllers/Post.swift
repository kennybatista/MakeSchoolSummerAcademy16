 First we create a background task. When a background task gets created iOS generates a unique ID and returns it. We store that unique id in the photoUploadTask property. The API requires us to provide an expirationHandler in the form of a closure. That closure runs when the extra time that iOS permitted us has expired. In case the additional background time wasn't sufficient, we are required to cancel our task! Within this block you should delete any temporary resources that you created - in the case of our photo upload we don't have any. Additionally you have to call UIApplication.sharedApplication().endBackgroundTask, otherwise your app will be terminated!
                 
                 
 After we've created the background task we save the post and imageFile by calling saveInBackgroundWithBlock(); however, this time we aren't handing nil as a completion handler!
                 
                 
 Within the completion handler of saveInBackgroundWithBlock() we inform iOS that our background task is completed. This block gets called as soon as the image upload is finished. The API for background jobs makes us responsible for calling UIApplication.sharedApplication().endBackgroundTask as soon as our work is completed.
                 
                 
 Most of this code is once again boilerplate code. Instead of memorizing all the details of it, remember that is the place to come back to when you want to create a background job next time around.
